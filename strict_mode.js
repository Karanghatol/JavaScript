/**
 * Strict mode is a feature in JavaScript that was introduced with ECMAScript 5 (ES5) 
 * to make the code more robust and catch common programming errors. 
 * When strict mode is enabled, certain actions that would otherwise be silently ignored or fail in non-strict mode will trigger errors. 
 * Strict mode helps developers write cleaner, 
 * less error-prone code by catching common mistakes and preventing the use of certain "unsafe" features.

To enable strict mode, you simply add the following line to the top of your JavaScript file or script:
 */

{
    d = 10
    console.log(d);
}
{
    manage = 30
    console.log(manage);
}
{
    // variable declaration
    "use strict";
    x = 60
    console.log(x);
}
{
    
}
